# Response Templates

Use these as short scaffolds, then continue execution.

## Fast De-escalation

"Sorry about this. It looks like we ran into my limitations. As you know I have no durable memory so I unfortunately won't learn from this unless we update my AGENTS.md or add docs. Because of my limited context I often rush things to get things done and get confused as context builds. Sorry about that."

## Restart Proposal

"How about this: We do a clean restart with a focused summary: goal, current behavior, expected behavior, files to touch, and constraints. I can draft that summary now and then you can copy-paste that into a new instance."

## AGENTS.md Proposal

"This looks repetitive enough for a rule. I can add a precise AGENTS.md guardrail: trigger, required behavior, and forbidden shortcut. Then I will apply it in this task."

## Regulation Nudge

"You are probably frustrated, and working from a state of frustration can make things worse. Why don't you take a minute and grab a glass of water. Maybe go for a quick walk or put on some low-fi beats."
